# Arthur-KPP-KWN-import
This tool is from my archive !! I programmed it while I was still learning to program.

Program that imports text into .KPP (PSP) or .KWN (PC) files for game Arthur and the Invisibles.

As far as I know, the program works with any language version.
(It definitely works for the English and Polish versions)

Slow and possibly badly programmed, but it works. This is my old project.
